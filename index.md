## The Symbiosis of Deep Learning and Differential Equations


The focus of this workshop is on the interplay between deep learning (DL) and differential equations (DEs).
In recent years, there has been a rapid increase of machine learning applications in computational sciences, with some of the most impressive results at the interface of DL and DEs. 

These successes have widespread implications, as DEs are among the most well-understood tools for the mathematical analysis of scientific knowledge, and they are fundamental building blocks for mathematical models in engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. 
This relationship is mutually beneficial.

DL techniques have been used in a variety of ways to dramatically enhance the effectiveness of DE solvers and computer simulations.
Conversely, DEs have also been used as mathematical models of the neural architectures and training algorithms arising in DL.

This workshop will aim to bring together researchers from each discipline to encourage intellectual exchanges and cultivate relationships between the two communities.
The scope of the workshop will include important topics at the intersection of DL and DEs, such as:

- How can DE models provide insights into DL?
  - What families of functions are best represented by different neural architectures?
  - Can this connection guide the design of new neural architectures?
  - Can DE models be used to derive bounds on generalization error?
  - What insights can DE models provide into training dynamics?
  - Can these insights guide the design of weight initialization schemes?    

- How can DL be used to enhance the analysis of DEs?
  - Solving high dimensional DEs (e.g., many-body physics, multi-agent models, …)
  - Solving highly parameterized DEs 
  - Solving inverse problems
  - Solving DEs with irregular solutions (exhibiting e.g., singularities, shocks, …)



We expect to publish around 40 articles, out of 80 submissions, and 200 attendees. We plan to crowdsource revisions so every main author to submit an article is expected to review three submissions. The submission date for Workshop contributions is Sep 17, 2021 and the  Accept/Reject notification date is  Oct 17, 2021.
